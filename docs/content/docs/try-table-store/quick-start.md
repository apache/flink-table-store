# Quick Start

This document provides a quick introduction to using Flink Table Store. Readers of this
document will be guided to create a simple dynamic table to read and write it.

## Step 1: Downloading Flink

{{< hint info >}}
__Note:__ Table Store is only supported starting from Flink 1.15.
{{< /hint >}}

[Download the latest binary release](https://flink.apache.org/downloads.html) of Flink,
then extract the archive:

```bash
$ tar -xzf flink-*.tgz
```

## Step 2: Copy Table Store Bundle Jar

{{< stable >}}
[Download the latest binary release](https://flink.apache.org/downloads.html) of
Flink Table Store.
{{< /stable >}}
{{< unstable >}}

In order to build Table Store bundle jar you need the source code.
[clone the git repository]({{< github_repo >}}).

To clone from git, enter:

```bash
git clone {{< github_repo >}}
```

The simplest way of building Table Store is by running:

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

You can find the bundle jar in `"./flink-table-store-dist/target/flink-table-store-dist-*.jar"`.

{{< /unstable >}}

Copy table store bundle jar to flink/lib:

```bash
cp flink-table-store-dist-*.jar FLINK_HOME/lib/
```

## Step 3: Start Flink Local Cluster

To start a local cluster, run the bash script that comes with Flink:

```bash
$ ./bin/start-cluster.sh
```

You should be able to navigate to the web UI at [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) to view
the Flink dashboard and see that the cluster is up and running.

Start the SQL Client CLI:

```bash
./bin/sql-client.sh embedded
```

## Step 4: Create Dynamic Table

```sql
-- set root path to session config
SET 'table-store.file.path' = '/tmp/table_store';

-- create a word count dynamic table without 'connector' option
CREATE TABLE word_count (
    word STRING PRIMARY KEY NOT ENFORCED,
    cnt BIGINT
);
```

## Step 5: Write Data

```sql
-- create a word data generator table
CREATE TABLE word (
    word STRING
) WITH (
    'connector' = 'datagen',
    'fields.word.length' = '1'
);

-- table store requires checkpoint interval in streaming mode
SET 'execution.checkpointing.interval' = '10 s';

-- write streaming data to dynamic table
INSERT INTO word_count SELECT word, COUNT(*) FROM word;
```

## Step 6: OLAP Query

```sql
-- use tableau result mode
SET 'sql-client.execution.result-mode' = 'tableau';

-- switch to batch mode
RESET 'execution.checkpointing.interval';
SET 'execution.runtime-mode' = 'batch';

-- olap query the table
SELECT * FROM word_count;
```

You can execute the query multiple times and observe the changes in the results.

## Step 7: Streaming Query

```sql
-- switch to streaming mode
SET 'execution.runtime-mode' = 'streaming';

-- track the changes of table and calculate the count interval statistics
SELECT cnt, COUNT(*) AS cnt_cnt FROM word_count GROUP BY cnt;
```

With the streaming mode, you can get the change log of the dynamic table,
and perform new stream computations.

## Step 8: Exit

Exit sql-client:

```sql
EXIT;
```

Stop the Flink local cluster:

```bash
$ ./bin/stop-cluster.sh
```

## Congratulation!

You have completed the Flink Table Store Quick Start.
